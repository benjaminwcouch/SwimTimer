A repetitive counter Timer

For many a daily activities, the standard timer or stopwatch is not sufficient.
HIIT is a good example. A set of predefined timers runnning repetetively is necessary for the HIIT workout.
Keeping that in mind, this timer is designed.

Only the initial phase is completed.
The base is ready. Mostly functionaning.

Thorough complex testing and additional feature implementation pending!
